title: Ember Component Architecture
---

This learning section is about the various bits and pieces that are the
ingredients to a component architecture. The demos and examples are written
in ember, yet this whole section is framework agnostic and can also be applied
to any other frontend framework or library that provides components.

<LinkTo @route="component-architecture.types">Component Types</LinkTo> indicate to a consumer _how
to interact_ with them from the _outside_ and signal the _mechanics_ to plug
and play them together.

<LinkTo @route="component-architecture.patterns">Component Patterns</LinkTo> hint the consumer about
the _inner workings_.

<LinkTo @route="component-architecture.classification">Component Classification</LinkTo> set the
range from generic to specific and how components align on that spectrum.

<LinkTo @route="component-architecture.specialization"> Specialization</LinkTo> explains ways to
make components more specific.

<LinkTo @route="component-architecture.best-practices">Best Practices</LinkTo> are derieved from
all of the above.
