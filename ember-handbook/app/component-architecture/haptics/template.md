## Invocation

The element can either be written as _inline_ or _block_,
some components allow both. A block level element offers more freedom to
control the contents inside.

## Styled

Whether visuals are applied or not to make the content look
beautiful.

## Content

The component shows content _visibly_, it's mostly interactive element(s) and
displaying data.

## Structure

The component uses elements to structure and organize its children, but
its own content is _invisible_.

## Yields

The component is replying with buildings blocks, acting as a construction
kit, to further build up the contents inside the block-level component.
Oftentimes the yielded elements are already linked with parent component and
provide a communication bridge.

## Logic

The intelligence level of a component: they are either smart or dumb.
