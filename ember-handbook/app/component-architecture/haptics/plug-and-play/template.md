title: Plug'n'Play Characteristics

## Content

Does the component _visibly_ show contents? Likely in the form of interactive
element(s) and/or displaying data.

## Styled

Whether visuals are applied or not to make the content look
beautiful.

When styling is applied, is it _safely_ styled intrinsically? Does it leak styling?
Will it cause side-effects to the layout I'm putting this component in?

## Structure

The component uses elements to structure and organize its children, but
its own content is _invisible_. Do I have to be careful when placing children
inside? Will the component have plan for the layout of children?
